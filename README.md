# üè∑ Open SourceMLOps Stack Recipes

A series of Terraform based recipes to provision popular MLOps stacks on the cloud.

At [ZenML](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml) we believe that annotation and labeling workflows are a core part of
the machine learning lifecycle. As an open-source tool, we wanted to highlight
and recognize the variety of tools that are available to help your workflows
become more data-centric. We had three core criteria to decide whether a
particular tool could make it into the list:

- The tool has an open-source licence.
- The tool is actively maintained.
- The tool is functional and fit for purpose.

We welcome contributions to this list, so if you know of a tool that
we've missed or if you've built one yourself, please do create a PR!

üî• **Do you use these tools or do you want to add one to your MLOps stack?** At
ZenML, we are looking for design partnerships and collaboration to develop the
integrations and workflows around using annotation within the MLOps lifecycle.

Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/) and leave us a message!
